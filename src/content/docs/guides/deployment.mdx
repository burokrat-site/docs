This guide will help you deploy your application with Coolify.

## Adding new project

<Steps>

1. Click on `Projects` in the left sidebar. Press the `+Add` button.

   Name your project, e.g., `website`.

   You will be redirected to the project's environments page where the `production` environment is already created. You can add a `development` environment later.

2. Click on the `production` environment.

   You will be redirected to the resources page. Here you can add new resources such as databases and GitHub repositories.

   First, we will add the GitHub repository. After that, we will add the database.

3. Click on the `Add Resource` button.

   Choose the `Private repository (with GitHub app)` option.

   Since we don't have a `GitHub App` installed yet, you will be redirected to the GitHub App creation page.

   Click on the `+ Add GitHub App` button.

   - Leave the autogenerated name field as it is, since it has to be unique across all of GitHub.
   - Fill in the organization field with your GitHub organization name, e.g., `burokrat-site`, or leave it blank if you keep the repository in your personal account.
   - Press the `Continue` button.

   You will be redirected back to the Sources page. Press the `Register now` button.

   Authorize the Coolify app on GitHub.

   Press the `Install Repositories on GitHub` button.

   Choose either `All repositories` or `Only select repositories` option.

   You will be redirected to the GitHub App page. Press `Save` and go back to the `Projects` page.

   Choose your project and press the `+ Add new resource` button. Choose `Private repository (with GitHub app)` option and select the newly created GitHub app.

   Choose the repository you want to deploy, e.g., `website`, and press the `Load Repository` button.

   Select the `main` branch and `Dockerfile` build pack. Press the `Continue` button.

   You will be redirected to the `Configuration` page.

4. Create a database.

   Go back to the production environment resources page.

   Click on the `+ New` button.

   Scroll down and choose the `PostgreSQL` option. Select the `16 (default)` version.

   You will be redirected to the database's `Configuration` page.

   Scroll down to the `Postgres URL (internal)` field. Copy the URL and save it somewhere, as we will need it later.

   Press the `Start` button. Wait until the database is ready. Close the popup and go back to the repository configuration page.

5. Setting up environment variables.

   In the `Configuration` page choose `Environment Variables`, click on the `Developer View` button.

   Copy your local `.env` variables and paste them into the `Production Environment Variables` field. Press the `Save All Environment Variables` button.

   Go back into normal view by pressing the `Normal View` button.

   You can now change all the variables in this page.

   The mandatory variables are:

   - API_ACCESS_TOKEN
   - CRYPTO_SECRET
   - DATABASE_URL (we saved it earlier)
   - JWT_SECRET
   - SESSION_SECRET
   - STRIPE_SK

   Enter values and hit the `Deploy` button.

   On the Deployment page you can press the `Show Debug Logs` to watch the container build process.

</Steps>

 If everything went well, you should see the `Rolling update completed.` message.
