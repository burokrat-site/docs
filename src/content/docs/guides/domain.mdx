<Steps>

  1. Setting up DNS records.

      Go to your domain dashboard and choose the `DNS > Records` on the sidebar.

      Add 2 records:

      - Type A with Name `@`, IP `xx.xx.xx.xx` and proxy status `DNS only`.
      - Type A with Name `*`, IP `xx.xx.xx.xx` and proxy status `DNS only`.

      The `*` record called `wildcard` means that every subdomain of your domain will be redirected to your server where Coolify will handle it. 

      `DNS only` option means that Cloudflare wont proxy requests to your server, it will only forward them to the server.
      Although there are many benefits of using Cloudflare proxy, it will cause conflicts between Coolify and Cloudflare and requires more advanced configuration.

  2. Setting up Coolify address.

      In the Coolify dashboard, go to `Settings` and in the `Instance's Domain` field enter subdomain to access the dashboard e.g. https://coolify.burokrat.site

      Hit the `Save` button.

      Now you can inter the dashboard at the specified subdomain of your site.

  3. Adding domain to the site. 

     Go to the site repository settings (`projects` > `your project name` > `Applications` > `repository name` )

     On the `General` configuration page change the `Domain` field value from autogenerated to your domain, add www subdomain after comma e.g. `https://burokrat.site,https://www.burokrat.site`

     Change the `Direction` field value to `Redirect to non-www` (SEO friendly option)

     Press the `Save` button and the pres the `Restart` button to the changes to take effect.

</Steps>

After some time your site will be available at your domain
