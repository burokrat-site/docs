This guide will help you set up Coolify.


### Install Coolify

<Aside type="caution">
	You need to login as root user to setup Coolify.
  Some VPS providers do not allow root login by default. You can switch to root user with `sudo su` command.
</Aside>

Install Coolify with the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

Wait for the installation to complete.

After the installation is complete, you will see the following message:

```text
You can access Coolify through your Public IP: http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8000
```

This is the web interface you can access before setting up a domain.


### Registering

Register a new account. This will be your admin account. New users can be invited via email in the teams directory.

Skip onboarding.
